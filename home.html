        <p>
            My goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights and contribute to projects that use technology and 
            data to foster growth and innovation. In this portfolio, you’ll find a showcase of my work in programming, 
            data analysis, and system development.

            I hold a BSc in Computer Science and Electronics, with a robust foundation in programming, embedded systems, and digital circuit design. My expertise encompasses C and Java programming, microcontroller programming, and the development of IoT systems. I have undertaken projects involving embedded technologies, Verilog-based digital design, and communication systems, enabling me to devise innovative solutions in electronics.

Additionally, I possess hands-on experience in web development, exemplified by my creation of a Learning Management System (LMS) page using PHP. This project refined my capabilities in server-side development and designing dynamic, user-centric platforms.

Presently, I am augmenting my skillset in Data Analytics, honing proficiency in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel for data analysis and visualization. Although I am in the early stages of mastering this discipline, I am committed to continuous professional growth, striving to leverage data to extract actionable insights and inform strategic decisions.

Driven by a passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning, I aspire to contribute to projects that synthesize both embedded systems and data analysis, fostering innovation and facilitating data-driven business growth.
